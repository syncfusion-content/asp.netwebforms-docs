# Overview

The **Essential ASP.NET ColorPicker control** provides you a rich visual interface for color selection. You can select the color from the professionally designed palettes or custom color. By clicking a point on the color, you can change the active color to the color that is located under the pointer. 

You can also choose colors in different specifications; **red-green-blue-alpha (opacity) (RGBA), hue-saturation-value (HSV) and hexadecimal (HEX)**. The ColorPicker provides a selection of basic colors, standard presets, custom colors and color swatches.
