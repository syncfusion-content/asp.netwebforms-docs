# Overview

The **pivot client** control for ASP.NET provides support to bind both the OLAP and relational data sources.  You can visualize the results in graphical and tabular formats (chart and grid).The **pivot client** control is also used to create and edit a report on-the-fly that is stored for later use.


## Key features

The key features of the **pivot client** control are as follows:

* **Data source:** Binds the **pivot client** control with relational data source, Microsoft Analysis Services databases, and **XML/A** data sources.
* **Axis element builder:** Allows building an **OLAP/Pivot** report by placing elements in the different axes of the **pivot client**. There are four axes that are supported namely column, row, slicer, and values.
* **Member editor:** Lists out the members of the selected field for relational data source and members of the selected hierarchy in a tree-view-like structure for OLAP data source.
* **Toolbar:** The toolbar of the **pivot client** component provides options for exporting and manipulating the **OLAP/Pivot** report such as add report, new report, remove report, etc.
* **Cube dimension browser:** A tree-view-like structure that organizes the dimensions, measures, and named sets from the selected OLAP cube into independent logical groups.
* **Field list:** List which explores the fields available in the connected relational data source.
* **Visualization controls:** For a diagrammatic representation of the multidimensional data.
