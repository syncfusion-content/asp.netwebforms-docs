# Web accessibility

Web accessibility is an easy way to create a website or application by world wide users, including disabled users. You can develop sites with the help of assistive technologies. Essential JavaScript supports the Web UI accessibility resources. They are:

## WAI – ARIA supports in Essential JavaScript.Net Grid

This helps enable better user interaction in Grid control and this uses the W3C’s Widget Design Patterns in the WAI specification and added customize attributes.

## Full Keyboard control supports in Essential JavaScript Grid

This helps to support Grid control with keyboard interaction. The key descriptions are:

{% highlight text %}

Alt + j            = focus

Ctrl + Home  = first row in Grid

Ctrl + End      = last row in Grid

PgDn              = next page to Grid

PgUp              = previous page to Grid

Home             = first cell in grid

End                 = last cell in grid

F2                    = Edit            //to enable editing [edit:{allowEditing:true}]

Enter              = Save request

Esc                  = Cancel request

Tab                 = Move Cell right

Shift                = Move Cell left

Ctrl + PgDn    = Last page in grid

Ctrl + Alt + PgUp     = First page in grid

Alt + Down Arrow  = Expand selected group //to enable [grouping{allowGrouping:true}]

Alt + Up Arrow       = Collapse selected group //to enable [grouping{allowGrouping:true}]

Ctrl + Down Arrow = Expand All //to enable [grouping{allowGrouping:true}]

Ctrl + UP Arrow      = Collapse All //to enable [grouping{allowGrouping:true}]

{% endhighlight %}
