## Key Features

The key features of the **PivotChart** control is listed as follows:

* **Data source** - Supports OLAP data binding with Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), XML/A data sources and Relational data sources.
* **Series** - A collection of series items that contain the actual data points is displayed on the chart.
* **Legend** - A color code that helps to differentiate between chart items. A legend also has labels beside each color to indicate that it applies to information from Series 1, Series 2, and so on.
* **Drill support** - Enables you to navigate to the inner levels in the row axis. 
* **Tooltip** - Displays data point values of respective chart series on mouse hover.
* **Zooming and scrolling** – Enables you to zoom into an area of the chart so the data can be viewed with more clarity.
