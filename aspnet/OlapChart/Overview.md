# Overview

The OLAP Chart control for ASP.NET is a lightweight control that reads OLAP information and visualizes it in graphical format with the ability to drill up and down.

## Key Features

The key features of the OLAP Chart control is listed as follows:

* Data source - Binds the OLAP Chart control with the Microsoft Analysis Services database and XML/A data sources.
* Series - A collection of series items that contain the actual data points is displayed on the chart.
* Legend - A color code that helps to differentiate between chart items. A legend also has labels beside each color to indicate that it applies to information from Series 1, Series 2, and so on.
* Drill-down support- Clicking on an item moves you to a level of greater detail. This feature is known as drill-down that is supported in the OLAPChart. 
* Tooltip - When the cursor is moved over an item, a tooltip appears displaying the data point values of the respective chart series. 
* Zooming and scrolling - The zooming and scrolling features enable you to zoom into an area of the chart so the data can be viewed more clearly.
