# RangeNavigator

RangeNavigator is a data visualization control.  It allows you to scroll and navigate through the data. This control easily combines with other controls such as Chart, GridView, etc., to create rich and powerful dashboards.

## Key Features

The RangeNavigator is composed of the following features: 

* Higher level label: Contains a time span format one level higher than the lower level DateTime values. For example, if the higher level label contains the year format (yyyy), the lower level label contains the Quarter format.
