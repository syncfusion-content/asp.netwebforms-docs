# Working with tables in ASP.NET Web Forms RichTextEditor control

## Insert a Table

You can insert a basic table by select the “Insert Table” tool from toolbar and drag the cursor over the grid until you highlight the number of columns and rows you want. A table can be inserted as large as with ten columns and eight rows (10 * 8 cells). When you finish inserting tables, click in a cell and start typing or insert an image.

N> If you want to make any adjustment with drawn table, you can [add/remove rows and columns](#insert-and-delete-a-row-or-column). 

### Custom Table

You can use custom table tools to insert tables with custom behaviors. You can create a table with more than ten columns and eight rows, as well as set the table related attributes (such as width, height, cell spacing/padding, and more) using the custom table dialog.
