# Overview 

DataManager helps in managing relational data in ASP.NET. Its rich features make querying data sources easier. The OData Client fully supports OData queries that are enabled in Web API & WCF data services.

DataManager supports different type of data binding, such as:

1. JSON
2. Web Services
3. OData

Basically, all services that have JSON acts as a transport.

## Key Features

Some important features of the DataManager for ASP.NET are:

1. **DataManager** - Communicates with data source and returns the desired result based on the Query provided.

2. **JavaScript Query** – **DataManager** have APIs for generating JavaScript data query with ease.

3. **CRUD in individual requests and Batch** – **CRUD** operations are fully supported. The options are enabled to commit the data as a single or multiple requests.

4. **Adaptors** – **Adaptors** are specific dataSource type aware interfaces that are used by **DataManager** to communicate with DataSource. Three adaptors are created. They are, ODataAdaptor, JsonAdaptor and UrlAdaptor

5. **Model binding** – Simple model binding is made using **DataManager**. You can directly bind Query result to **HTML** element.

6. Calculate and maintain aggregates, sorting order and paging

In other words, the DataManager fully supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) data operations, and provides both client-side and server-side support for sorting, paging, filtering, grouping, and aggregates.
