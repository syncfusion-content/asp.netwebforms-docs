* Format: Supports tag structure in both cloud format and list format.
* Font-size: Supports limiting the font size with a minimum and maximum ranges.
* RTL: Supports changing the TagCloud direction to right-to-left alignment.
* Themes: JavaScript controls include 12 built-in themes (6 flat and 6 gradient effects) and also support a custom skin option to set user-defined themes.
