* Highlight search: Supports highlighting the typed text in the suggestion list.
* Auto fill: Allows the control to automatically select the first suggested item.
* Keyboard navigation: Supports using the keyboard to focus on the control, navigate through the suggestion results, and select a value.
* RTL: Supports displaying the text box and suggestion list from right to left.
* Themes: The AutoComplete control features 13 built-in themes (six flat, six with gradient effects and a bootstrap theme), and also supports custom skin options for user defined themes.
